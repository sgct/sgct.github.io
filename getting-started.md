# Getting started

## CMake
In order to use SGCT, it has to be included in the `CMakeLists.txt` of your project.  In the majority of cases it is only necessary to:
```cmake
add_subdirectory(<path to sgct>)
target_include_directories(<your application> PUBLIC <path to sgct>/include)
target_link_libraries(<your application> PUBLIC sgct)
```

In that case, SGCT will automatically be included in your project file when generating it.


## Commandline argument
You can find the available commandline arguments by either looking at the `commandline.cpp` file's `helpMessage()` function, or by executing your application with the commandline argument `-help`, which will print that message and immediately terminate the application.  The most important setting that might be useful for the user is the `-config` parameter which accepts a single argument that is the path to an XML configuration file that is loaded and applied at application startup.  The file format of the configuration files are described in greater detail [here](configuration-files.md).  If no configuration file is provided, SGCT will create a "cluster" consisting of a single node with a single 1280x720 window.

When running multiple instances of the application on the same machine (if your configuration file is configured to support that), you will also need the `-local n` and `-client` parameters.  As the automatic IP detection cannot determine which of the nodes to use, the `-local n` parameter has to be used to distinguish the nodes, starting with the number 0, using `-local 0` for the node identified by the IP address `127.0.0.1`, `-local 1` for the address `127.0.0.2` and so forth.  Each node that is *not* the server also needs to be started with the `-client` parameter or it will think it is the server and not try to connect to the actual server node.  [Commandline arguments](commandline-arguments.md) contains more detailed information about the available commandline arguments that can be passed to SGCT applications.


## First application
Creating applications using SGCT is very simple and requires only a bit of coding.  Here is an example that opens a window and sets its color to white.  Please note that OpenGL only supports OpenGL versions 3.3 and newer, which means that the legacy fixed-pipeline functios will *not* work.

See also the examples in the `src/apps` folder for more examples on how to use SGCT.  These can be included in your project by enabling the `SGCT_EXAMPLES` option in CMake.

```cpp
#include "sgct/sgct.h"

void drawFun(RenderData data) {
    glClearColor(1.f, 1.f, 1.f, 1.f);
    glClear();
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  std::vector<std::string> arg(argv + 1, argv + argc);
  Configuration config = parseArguments(arg);
  config::Cluster cluster = loadCluster(config.configFilename);

  Engine::Callbacks callbacks;
  callbacks.draw = drawFun;

  try {
    Engine::create(cluster, callbacks, config);
  }
  catch (const std::runtime_error& e) {
    Log::Error("%s", e.what());
    Engine::destroy();
    return EXIT_FAILURE;
  }

  Engine::instance().render();
  Engine::destroy();
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```
