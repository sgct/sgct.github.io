title: User

parent: Configuration Files
---

This node specifies a user position and parameters.  In most cases, only a single unnamed user is necessary.  However, in more general cases, it is possible to assign `User`s to specific [Viewports](viewport) to provide a more fine-grained control over the rendering that occurs in that viewport.

### Attributes
`name` *special* \[ string \]
> Specifies the name of this user.  Each user needs to have a unique name, but there also *has* to be exactly one user present that has an empty name (or without a `name` attribute) which is used as the default user.

`eyeSeparation` *optional* \[ float >= 0 \]
> Determines the eye separation used for stereoscopic viewports.  If no viewports in the configuration are using stereo, this setting is ignored.

### Children
`Pos` \[ 0 - 1 \]
 > A linear offset of the user position.  Must define three float attributes `x`, `y`, and `z`.  The default values are `x=0`, `y=0`, `z=0`, meaning that no linear offset is applied to the user's position.

`Orientation` \[ 0 - 1 \]
 > Describes a fixed orientation for the viewing direction of this user.  This can be provided either as Euler angles or as a quaternion.  The two modes *cannot* be mixed.  The following descibes the different attributes that can be used for the orientation.  Please note that *all* attributes for the chosen method have to be specified.  If the `Matrix` attribute is also specified, it will overwrite the value specified here.
 > 
 > Euler angles:
 >  - `pitch` or `elevation`: negative numbers tilt the camera downwards;  positive numbers tilt upwards.  The allowed range is \[-90, 90\].
 >  - `yaw`, `heading`, or `azimuth`: negative numbers pan the camera to the left;  positive numbers pan to the right.  The allowed range is \[-360, 360\].
 >  - `roll` or `bank`: negative numbers rotate the camera to the left;  positive numbers to the right.  The allowed range is \[-180, 180\].
 > 
 > Quaternion:
 >  - `x`
 >  - `y`
 >  - `z`
 >  - `w`
 > 
 >  Example:  `<Orientation pitch="20.0" elevation="-12.0" roll="0.0" />`

`Matrix` \[ 0 - 1 \]
> A generic transformation matrix that is applied to the orientation of this user.  This value will overwrite the value specified in `Orientation`.  The attributes used for the matrix are named `x0`, `y0`, `z0`, `w0`, `x1`, `y1`, `z1`, `w2`, `x2`, `y2`, `z2`, `w2`, `x3`, `y3`, `z3`, `w3` and are used in this order to initialize the matrix in a column-major order.  All 16 of these values have to be present in this attribute and have to be floating point values.
> 
> `transpose` *optional* \[ boolean \]
>  > If this value is present and `true` the values provided are interpreted as being in row-major order, rather than column-major order.  The default is `false`, making the matrix column-major.

`Tracking` \[ 0 - 1 \]
> Provides information about whether this user should be tracked using a VRPN-based tracker.  This child node contains two attributes with information about the tracker that this user should be associated with.
> 
> `tracker` \[ string \]
> > The name of the tracker group that this user should be linked with.  This name must be a name of a [Tracker](tracker) that is specified in this configuration.
> 
> `device` \[ string \]
> > The name of the device in the tracker group that should be used to control the tracking for this user.  The specified device has to be a [Device](device) that was specified in the [Tracker](tracker) `tracker`.
