This node defines a group of tracking devices or sensors as they are advertised by the VRPN standard.  See its documentation for more information on this.

# Attributes
`name` \[ string \]
 > The name of the tracker group.

# Children
 - [`Device`](device) \[ 0 - inf \]

`Offset` \[ 0 - 1 \]
 > A linear offset of the class of trackers.  Must define three float attributes `x`, `y`, and `z`.  The default values are `x=0`, `y=0`, `z=0`, which means that no linear offset is applied to the tracker.

`Orientation` \[ 0 - 1 \]
 > Describes a fixed orientation of this class of trackers.  This can be provided either as Euler angles or as a quaternion.  The two modes *cannot* be mixed.  The following descibes the different attributes that can be used for the orientation.  Please note that *all* attributes for the chosen method have to be specified.  If the `Matrix` attribute is also specified, it will overwrite the value specified here.
 > 
 > Euler angles:
 >  - `pitch` or `elevation`: negative numbers tilt the camera downwards;  positive numbers tilt upwards.  The allowed range is \[-90, 90\].
 >  - `yaw`, `heading`, or `azimuth`: negative numbers pan the camera to the left;  positive numbers pan to the right.  The allowed range is \[-360, 360\].
 >  - `roll` or `bank`: negative numbers rotate the camera to the left;  positive numbers to the right.  The allowed range is \[-180, 180\].
 > 
 > Quaternion:
 >  - `x`
 >  - `y`
 >  - `z`
 >  - `w`
 > 
 >  Example:  `<Orientation pitch="20.0" elevation="-12.0" roll="0.0" />`

`Scale` \[ 0 - 1 \]
 > A scaling factor for this class of trackers.  The default value is `1.0`.

`Matrix` \[ 0 - 1 \]
> A generic transformation matrix that is applied to all trackers in this group.  This value will overwrite the value specified in `Orientation`.  The attributes used for the matrix are named `x0`, `y0`, `z0`, `w0`, `x1`, `y1`, `z1`, `w2`, `x2`, `y2`, `z2`, `w2`, `x3`, `y3`, `z3`, `w3` and are used in this order to initialize the matrix in a column-major order.  All 16 of these values have to be present in this attribute and have to be floating point values.
> 
> `transpose` *optional* \[ boolean \]
>  > If this value is present and `true` the values provided are interpreted as being in row-major order, rather than column-major order.  The default is `false`, making the matrix column-major.
